This is an overview that acts as an easy reference for those who are helping me in my current job search for interesting and impactful problems to work on. It does not replace my [full resume](/assets/files/EricHarrisResume.pdf).

# Who I am

I'm a US-based (Arizona) engineering manager and technical lead with 25 years of professional engineering experience.

I've worked remotely for over 6 years, most recently leading fully-remote full-stack, cross-functional teams. Additionally, I've helped mature engineering organizations through implementing standards, developing career ladders, and leading company wide inititatives focused on employee growth and engagement.

People have told me that I'm their favorite manager and team lead. I empower teams to get work done and grow their skills. I've dealt with reports on PIPs, supported them through personal crises, and developed new teams into high performing and high trust teams. People level up by working with me. So do companies.

# What I’m looking for

Full-time, remote opportunities in **leadership roles**. While not preferred, I am open to looking at interesting Individual Contributor (IC) opportunities. 

Salary range is **$200k-250k+** per year, depending on title and responsibility. 

## Roles I’m seeking

* Sr. Engineering Manager / Engineering Manager
* CTO / Director / Vice President roles focused on growing and maturing an earlier Engineering organization
* Team Lead

## What I want to do 

My focus is on mission-driven companies in the private sector. I have a strong preference for non-coding leadership roles where I can help individuals grow and empower teams to do their best work. However I am not opposed to digging into technical or coding areas as needed to assist the team's direction and growth.

# My top criteria 

* **Remote work** is a must - I do my best work when I have control of my work environment
* **People-first** - I thrive in environments that prioritize empathy, intelligence, and community in the workplace
* **Inclusivity** - I want to work in an organization that treats inclusion and equity as part of their values
* **Private sector** - I am looking for work outside of government/civic tech for now 
* **Humane work/life balance** - I am fully present and engaged during work hours and enjoy a full, rich life outside of work. One feeds the other and I appreciate companies that support that.

# What I don't want

* Government or civic tech roles right now
* Fully in-office or hybrid positions
* Individual contributor (IC) roles or leadership roles that require significant hands-on coding
* Roles requiring significant travel
* Consulting or contract positions
* Very early-stage startups or pre-seed companies
